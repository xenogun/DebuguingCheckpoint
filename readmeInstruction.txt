Steps to Debug:

Open React Developer Tools and inspect the TodoItem component.

Check if the title prop is being passed correctly from the parent component.

If the prop is missing, trace back to the parent component  to ensure the prop is being passed.

Fix the issue by correcting the prop passing logic.

Verify the fix by checking the TodoItem component in React Developer Tools and the UI.
